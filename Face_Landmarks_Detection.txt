This script will continuously capture frames from your webcam, detect any faces in the frame, and draw landmarks on them.
It also calculates and prints the distance between the tip of the nose (landmark 30) and the right corner of 
the mouth (landmark 48), demonstrating one way you could use these landmarks to analyze facial features or expressions.
